title: Databot and Infobot LAN (Simple RAG AI Chatbot)
description: Databot and Infobot are two chatbot solutions developed at LAN to make data and information more accessible and user-friendly. Databot is an AI-powered chatbot that converts natural language into SQL queries. It allows users to access and visualize data quickly without needing to understand SQL syntax. This tool helps bridge the gap between non-technical users and complex datasets, enabling faster and easier decision-making. Infobot, on the other hand, is an information assistant trained using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. It answers user questions based on a curated set of documents stored in a Qdrant vector database. This makes Infobot reliable for delivering accurate and context-aware responses. Both chatbots are built using Chainlit, a Python-based framework that supports interactive AI applications, allowing for smooth development and deployment of conversational tools.
