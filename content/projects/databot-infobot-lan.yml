title: Databot and Infobot LAN (Simple RAG AI Chatbot)
description: Databot is an AI-powered chatbot that converts natural language into SQL queries. It allows users to access and visualize data quickly without needing to understand SQL syntax. This tool helps bridge the gap between non-technical users and complex datasets. Infobot, on the other hand, is an information assistant trained using a RAG approach. It answers user questions based on a curated set of documents stored in a Qdrant vector database. Both chatbots are built using Chainlit, a Python-based framework that supports interactive AI applications.
