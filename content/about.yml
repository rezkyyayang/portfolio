  Hello, I am **Rezky Yayang (@rezkyyayang)**. I am a Junior Statistician at the National Institute of Public Administration (NIPA) Indonesia, specializing in data analysis and visualization. With a Bachelor's degree in Applied Statistics from STIS Polytechnic of Statistics, I have developed a strong foundation in statistical methods, programming, and data processing. My work focuses on providing open statistical data as part of Indonesia's One Data initiative, integrating applications with interconnected data, and conducting workshops for government employees on data processing and analysis.

  ## Education

  A graduate of Applied Statistics from **STIS Polytechnic of Statistics** (Jakarta, Indonesia). Learned about calculus, linear algebra, algorithm and programming, probability and mathematical statistics, statistical methods, sampling theory, survey and census methodology, and official statistics. The bachelor thesis was titled *"Alternative School Quality Assessment in Secondary-Level through School Quality Index (SQI),"* which integrated several indicators of school quality such as students, teachers, and facilities quality obtained from the Basic Education Data. The project was completed with a grade A and a final GPA of 3.69/4.00.

  Previously studied Mathematics and Natural Sciences at **Senior High School 1 Tegal**, Central Java, where I learned both basic and advanced science subjects, as well as participated in computer and cyber extracurricular activities.
